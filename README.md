# Comic_Store
###Technology Used

For my *Comic Store* I used Express, Mongoose, EJS and Node.js.
It was built using the MVC structure and utilizing the 7 Restful Routes:

1.Index // GET
2.New //GET
3.Create //POST
4.Show //GET
5.Edit //GET
6.Update //PUT
7.Delete //DELETE

###Approach
The first thing I did was started jotting down my ideas and drawing things out. I wireframed a few of the pages for the site and how I wanted them to look and what I wanted them to use and do. Then I made a game plan and a schedule for myself giving each day a set of *to do items.* I also drew out my file structure and what files and directories would need to be created and for what.  I then started my build small and worked outwards. Started with my Routes and got the first several built and continued from there. Once all the routes and pages were functional I moved onto some CSS styling and started making an outline of how I wanted them to look. After that I moved on to the buttons and making sure the Edit, Delete and Buy buttons did what I wanted them to do. Next was the registration and the login. In between all of these things was more CSS styling and changes and additions to the pages to start smoothing things out and getting the aesthetics right. Once I was able to register and login a user I then built some member's only features including a link to a separate page with images. After some trial and error with different ideas, I settled on a column of images that scale larger on hover.
###Problems
Some difficulties with the login part, registration was fine - but once a correct password was entered it was throwing an error.
The other challenge was with Heroku, the initial setup was fine and without incident. After several commits and pushes I was getting a cannot GET error.
###Notes
Overall things went fairly smooth and I enjoyed this project. Going back I might do more for special variant pages or maybe a Trivia Game could be added. I really wanted to do a carousel of the images but couldn't get the javascript to link properly.
